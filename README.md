Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Update-01:
After learning DOM manipulation, I added buttons and event listeners to them, so when the user clicks on a button, he starts to play one round of "rps" game. The score is displayed on the page. When a user or computer achieves 5 wins, it automatically declares him the winner and the user is notified.

In this project, i was practicing basics of JavaScript. I did a few functions, used a few methods.
The user interface is not created, but the user is asked to enter a value via the prompt() method, and the entire result is printed in the console.
